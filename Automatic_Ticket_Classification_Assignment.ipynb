              "'i received an offer from chase xxxx visa promising a companion airline pass xxxx bonus points for opening a chase xxxx visa card i applied for the card online in xxxxxxxx providing my current email address phone number and address i was approved in xxxx i requested paperless billing statementscorrespondence and assumed that my current contact information provided at time of approval would be utilized by chase for the xxxx xxxx \\n\\nhaving previous chase credit card products i was able to log into my online account and setup automatic bill payment for my account i used my card as needed to earn the companion pass and bonus points and assumed the auto payments were being made from my checking account as i viewed line items that had chase in the description and as i was not receiving paper statementsemails or phone calls from chase regarding my xxxx account \\n\\nin reviewing my checking account statement in xxxx and realizing the that the chase line item was actually an auto payment for one of my husbands credit cards and was not in fact for the xxxx visa card i reached out to chase xxxx visa immediately \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i reached out to the customer service phone number listed on the back of my card  payments are due on the xxxx of the month  to learn that i was  days past due and explained that auto payment had been requested on my end via the online tool which they explained could take  business cycles but did not appear to have gone into affect \\n\\nadditionally i learned that they did not have the correct contact information in the system but instead had reached out to old email addresses and telephone contact information from previous accounts that had auto populated instead of using the correct information i had provided at the time of application \\n\\ni made a payment by phone immediately to payoff the entire balance requested auto payment to be setup and confirmed on their end as well as requested that the current contact information be setup in the system to avoid missing communications in the future \\n\\nthey made notation in the account of the challenge reversed all late charges and ensured me that the late payment would not be reported to the credit bureau due to the banking error also confirmed that i had met the required spend to earn the bonus and given the banking error reversal of late charges payment in full and notation that i would be eligible to receive the companion pass and bonus points which i have received this reassured me that there would not be any negative credit reporting as it appeared that they had addressed the issue on their end \\n\\nall subsequent payments have been made on time and as of xxxxxxxx the account has a  balance due to charges made after payment in full \\n\\nin xxxxxxxx i received an email from xxxx alert service that i subscribe to that my credit score had decreased from xxxx to xxxx i opened the xxxx file which stated a late payment was reported by chase for xxxx i filed a dispute and in xxxx received an email from xxxx  stating the dispute had been resolved upon further investigation it noted that the negative reporting was not being removed \\n\\ni contacted chase xxxx visa explained the negative reporting the agent reviewed the notes in the account and verified that they had made notation of the banking error due to the internet site not correctly setting up auto payment and the reversal of all late charges they stated that the  credit bureau unit  was not currently open and requested i call back the next day and request to speak to the unit as they would be able to to correct the information \\n\\ni followed the advice and spoke with xxxx cbu specialist in the xxxx mo call center after a long period of discussion xxxx informed me that there was nothing that he could do to update the file and remove the late payment reporting to the bureau \\n\\nafter requesting all notation on my file he advised i send a fax to the  business office  at  xxxx  xxxx but that there was not a live person to speak with nor an email that i could send the request to \\n\\ni asked to speak to his supervisor at which point he transferred me away from his department to a supervisor in the customer service department without telling me that he was actually transferring me out of the credit bureau unit back to xxxx customer service \\n\\nin speaking with xxxx in customer service i believed that i was still speaking to the credit bureau department i recalled all events she confirmed the notation in the account additionally i advised her that even after multiple attempts and confirmation that my current contact information had been updated that on xxxxxxxx my online account was still displaying old contact information as the default for all chase accounts i was able to uncover this while attempting to log into my account i received a screen that stated that i needed to enter a code to proceed and the phone numbersemail that were prepopulated by the website to receive the codes were outdated information i had to call the phone number listed to receive the access code and that once i was able to gain access into the account i confirmed that that while my current contact information was listed the default contact information that was highlighted on the top was actually old out dated information \\n\\ni explained to her that when i tried to update the info on the site it would not allow me to delete the old info or update the current info to be set as the default for the account she assisted with updating on her end had me log out and log back in to confirm that the correct information was now showing on my end as the default contact information \\n\\ngiven all of the challenges with the site that have been noted extensively as well as the notation of the banking challenge due to the malfunction of the auto payment setup i asked if she would be able to assist with removing the negative reporting at this point she advised me that i had been transferred out of the credit bureau department and that she would attempt to connect with a credit bureau specialist to see what could be done i explained that i had already spoken with xxxx in that department and that i was hoping to speak with his supervisor when he had transferred me to her she stated that the supervisors in that department can take up to  days to provide a call back \\n\\nshe then got another credit bureau specialist on the phone named xxxx explained the situation and xxxx told her that there  was nothing that he could do to assist  \\n\\ni have never been late with a payment across all accounts i have spent numerous hours trying to resolve this matter with jp morgan chasexxxx as a result of chasexxxx xxxx it appears that my diligence to setup auto payment  provide current contact information for my account were not feasible and will now have a significant impact on the cost of credit that i will be seeking for a new home purchase mortgage given that my credit rating went from  outstanding  to  good  and is the main tool used by lenders for determining interest rates offered \\n\\ni am reaching out to you in hopes that you will be able to   assist with restoring my credit due to bankingit error on the part of the credit card issuer   by sharing my story prevent another person from being lured into getting a credit card from chase and have to deal with the same challenges i have faced'"
